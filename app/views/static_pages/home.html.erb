      <p>
        Brian and Chris, both graduates of Strath Haven High School, formed a small landscaping company in 9th grade. They worked together until parting ways after graduation. Now 10 years later they've decided to team up again to pioneer a new kind of landscaping company. A professional enterprise that emphasizes customer service above all else. The Green Team still provides outstanding quality but it's a happy customer that we strive for. Let us work for you and see how we do it.
