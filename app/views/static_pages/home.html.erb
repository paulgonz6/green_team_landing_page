      <p>
        Brian and Chris, both graduates of Strath Haven High School, formed a small landscaping company in 9th grade. They worked together until parting ways after graduation.  10 years later they teamed up again to pioneer a new kind of landscaping company, a professional enterprise that emphasizes customer service above all else.  The Green Team still delivers outstanding quality but it’s a happy customer that we strive for.
